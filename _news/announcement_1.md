So continues the creation of my website. 
Knowing very little about html and other computer languages (as well as no experience with github itself) is making it very difficult to muddle through this, but we're slowly getting there.

So far I have removed and added some sections in the heading. I have edited a few different bits and pieces of text, getting rid of the default template stuff. I figure if I need any of the info provided in some of those pages, I can go back to the source and read them there.

Not sure how long it will take to actually set up the skeleton of the website with my haphazard, on and off workstyle. Following that I will actually need to start moving my written material across, as well as type up anything that I only have available in the material world. 

That's enough distraction for now,
Thanks for reading!
