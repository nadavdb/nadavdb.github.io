A few years past the age of 30, Nadav feels like an aging potato, tendrils and lumps growing from various places where things were once smooth.
Nadav is undergoing a Bachelor of Arts, Majoring in Creative Writing, at the mostly prestigious and questionably capitalist University of Wollongong.
If Nadav were here right now, I'm sure he would have more to say about himself, but, being a humble human he has retreated into nonsense and will only emerge when presented with coffee or chocolate. Or failing that, when the sun goes down.
